***EXPLANATION***

Dear group mates i created attributes and methods as much as i can, if you want to add another
attribute or method, you can. mates who will work subclasses have to give attetion to attributes and methods
were added or not.

Also species and class names will be given directly when you create constructor, pay attention to this.

When you override methods you can change its block.

if you have any suggestion about changing some part of this project, you can write from whatsapp or discord.

Dont forget you have to create your own branch with your names and push it to remote repository.
